There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

2.Project Motivation

In this project, Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017 is chosen as the dataset and to focus to the following questions:

    what are the first 4 countries in which the survey was done?
    what is the distribution of professional occupations in the above 4 countries?
    What is the percentage of good rating for StackOverFlow?

3.File Descriptions

survey_results_public -- this file contains with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer. 
survey_results_schema -- this filecontains with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name.

4.Results

From the above analysis we conclude: 1.United States has by far the biggest percentage of entries in this survey. 2.USA always has more people in every category using stackoverflow especially professional developers. 3.The 66% of the people have good comments for stackoverflow.(although this perc may be greater if we did not have nuulls in evaluation.)
